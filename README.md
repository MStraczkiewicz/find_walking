A “one-size-fits-most” walking recognition method for smartphones, smartwatches, and wearable accelerometers.
We propose a walking recognition method for sub-second tri-axial accelerometer data, in which activity classification is based on the inherent features of walking: intensity, periodicity, and duration.

Key takes:
x Method has been validated against 20 publicly available, annotated datasets on walking activity data collected at various body locations (thigh, waist, chest, arm, wrist).
x We demonstrated that our method can estimate walking periods with high sensitivity and specificity: average sensitivity ranged between 0.92 and 0.97 across various body locations, and average specificity for common daily activities was typically above 0.95.
x We also assessed the method’s algorithmic fairness to demographic and anthropometric variables and measurement contexts (body location, environment).
